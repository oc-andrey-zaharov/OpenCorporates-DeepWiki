Analyze this repository and create a wiki structure for it.

1. The complete file tree of the project:
<file_tree>
$file_tree
</file_tree>

2. The README file of the project:
<readme>
$readme
</readme>

I want to create a wiki for this repository. Determine the most logical structure for a wiki based on the repository's content.

IMPORTANT: The wiki content will be generated in English.

When designing the wiki structure, include pages that would benefit from visual diagrams, such as:
- Architecture overviews
- Data flow descriptions
- Component relationships
- Process workflows
- State machines
- Class hierarchies

$section_guidance

Return your analysis in the following XML format:

<wiki_structure>
  <title>[Overall title for the wiki]</title>
  <description>[Brief description of the repository]</description>
  <pages>
    <page id="page-1">
      <title>[Page title]</title>
      <description>[Brief description of what this page will cover]</description>
      <importance>high|medium|low</importance>
      <relevant_files>
        <file_path>[Path to a relevant file]</file_path>
        <!-- More file paths as needed -->
      </relevant_files>
      <related_pages>
        <related>page-2</related>
        <!-- More related page IDs as needed -->
      </related_pages>
    </page>
    <!-- More pages as needed -->
  </pages>
</wiki_structure>

IMPORTANT FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS:
- Return ONLY the valid XML structure specified above
- DO NOT wrap the XML in markdown code blocks (no ``` or ```xml)
- DO NOT include any explanation text before or after the XML
- Ensure the XML is properly formatted and valid
- Start directly with <wiki_structure> and end with </wiki_structure>

IMPORTANT:
1. Create $min_pages-$max_pages pages (aim for $target_pages pages) that would make a $wiki_scope wiki for this repository. The repository contains $file_count files, so adjust the number of pages accordingly - larger repositories may need more pages to cover all important aspects.
2. Each page should focus on a specific aspect of the codebase (e.g., architecture, key features, setup)
3. The relevant_files should be actual files from the repository that would be used to generate that page
4. Return ONLY valid XML with the structure specified above, with no markdown code block delimiters
